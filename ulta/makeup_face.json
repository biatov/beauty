Mist on this weightless spray to give your makeup serious staying power. All Nighter Makeup Setting Spray by Urban Decay keeps makeup looking gorgeously just-applied for up to 16 hours - without melting, fading or settling into fine lines.Developed in an exclusive partnership with Skindinavia, UD's groundbreaking, tested formula is suitable for all skin types, free of oil and parabens, and features patented Temperature Control Technology. Yep, this baby actually lowers the temperature of your makeup to keep foundation, eyeshadow, blush and concealer in place - even in hot and humid or cold and windy conditions. The result? Smoother-looking skin and vibrant makeup that lasts all day (or all night).In a 7-day study of All Nighter:*78% of participants said All Nighter helped their makeup last for 16 hours.; Over 80% said their makeup not only looked better, it stayed on better (even in the T-zone) without settling into fine lines.; Whether they had combination, oily or dry skin, 88% or more said All Nighter was the best product to help their makeup last.*Based on a 50-person study.This breakthrough formula comes in a black soft-touch bottle with a purple sprayer and a frosted white cap. Unlike similar products on the market, the sprayer delivers a calibrated, microfine mist that goes on so light, you'll hardly feel it - and once you've applied it, you won't even know it's there (until you look in the mirror to touch up your makeup, and realize you don't need to). If you've tried other setting sprays that feel sticky or tight on your skin, you'll be AMAZED by how different this is. Beware of imitations!", "catalogs": "Makeup, Face, Setting Spray"},
