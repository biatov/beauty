Toppik Hair Building Fibers are made from pure organic Keratin Protein; the same protein found in human hair.  These tiny microfiber hairs are electro-statically charged to form a magnetic attraction with your existing hair - however thin - and blend perfectly to conceal the appearance of thinning and balding in seconds. With seven, color-matched fiber choices available, you can conceal thinning hair on any natural hair color.  A few shakes of Toppik above your thinning areas will disperse thousands of tiny hair-like fibers that will match your existing hair color, and bond with your own hair to conceal thinning and create a more natural-looking, thicker, fuller head of hair. The secure bond stays put all day (and night) even in rain, wind, and perspiration. It won't come off until you wash it out. Safe, secure, and undetectable as close as two inches away.  Toppik is totally compatible with hair growth drugs like Minoxidil and Propecia. It's great for both men and women. From the very first application, people will admire the difference of your fuller hair. New acquaintances will never suspect that you ever had a hair loss problem.

With seven, color-matched fiber choices available, you can conceal thinning hair on any natural hair color.  A few shakes of Toppik above your thinning areas will disperse thousands of tiny hair-like fibers that will match your existing hair color, and bond with your own hair to conceal thinning and create a more natural-looking, thicker, fuller head of hair. The secure bond stays put all day (and night) even in rain, wind, and perspiration. It won't come off until you wash it out. Safe, secure, and undetectable as close as two inches away.  Toppik is totally compatible with hair growth drugs like Minoxidil and Propecia. It's great for both men and women. From the very first application, people will admire the difference of your fuller hair. New acquaintances will never suspect that you ever had a hair loss problem.

These tiny microfiber hairs are electro-statically charged to form a magnetic attraction with your existing hair - however thin - and blend perfectly to conceal the appearance of thinning and balding in seconds. With seven, color-matched fiber choices available, you can conceal thinning hair on any natural hair color.  A few shakes of Toppik above your thinning areas will disperse thousands of tiny hair-like fibers that will match your existing hair color, and bond with your own hair to conceal thinning and create a more natural-looking, thicker, fuller head of hair. The secure bond stays put all day (and night) even in rain, wind, and perspiration. It won't come off until you wash it out. Safe, secure, and undetectable as close as two inches away.  Toppik is totally compatible with hair growth drugs like Minoxidil and Propecia. It's great for both men and women. From the very first application, people will admire the difference of your fuller hair. New acquaintances will never suspect that you ever had a hair loss problem.

Capicellpro, a unique complex combining a biocompatible extract of wild apple fruits with shiitake mushroom protects the hair follicles and extends the life of each hair and growth cycle. Serenoa extract inhibits the 5a-reductase enzyme that causes hair loss and thinning, while essential oils with purifying and stimulating properties regenerate the area surrounding the hair bulb to effectively combat thinning. The formula also contains solanum glycoproteins to support healthier, denser hair to surface. This protein helps stimulate the production of keratin cells as it nurtures the hair bulb to jump start healthy hair growth. Last, but not least, antioxidant-rich grapeseed procyanidins work to protect the hair bulb from external aggressions while cananga oil boosts cellular exchanges allowing thicker, fuller, stronger hair that looks and feels denser from the inside out.

Toppik is totally compatible with hair growth drugs like Minoxidil and Propecia. It's great for both men and women.

{"description": "\nFor beautiful hair. Anywhere. With the foldable, lightweight, 1400-Watt Nanoe Compact Hair Dryer, you can dry and style hair beautifully at home, the gym or anywhere without drying it out. Nanoe creates and infuses moisture-rich particles into your hair while you dry to protect against heat and everyday brushing. Leaving you with smooth, shiny, healthy looking hair, wherever you go.So how does the Panasonic nanoe advantage work? Put simply, the nanoe hair dryer helps strengthen, protect and beautify hair by taking moisture from the outside and putting it on the inside. The instant you switch on the travel hair dryer, naturally occurring ions in the air are drawn in and broken down into significantly smaller particles that are then combined and held together by water molecules. These new nanoe particles - each containing 1,000x more moisture than regular ions - are gently infused into your hair while drying and styling. The result? Smoother, shinier hair and reduced damage from brushing.The lightweight nanoe travel hair dryer makes it easy to dry and style at home or on the go. The compact design and quick-fold handle fit neatly into bags and luggage for easy drying and touch-ups at the gym, work and travel wherever, whenever. When not in use, the space-saving folding hair dryer stores easily in drawers, on shelves or on a hook with the handy hanging loop.Panasonic's exclusive Quick-dry Nozzle simultaneously directs strong and soft airflows into the hair. It's the ideal design for concentrated styling, smooth, even drying from roots to ends and faster drying time. The Panasonic EH-NA27-K mini hair dryer delivers 1400-Watt power and high, medium and cool airflow settings to accommodate different styles, hair types and drying times. An easy-clean filter helps keep your Panasonic nanoe compact hair dryer running like new and operating at peak performance.Key Features:Panasonic nanoe technology; Compact Design with Folding Blowdryer Handle; Unique Quick-Dry Nozzle; 3 Airflow Settings: High, Medium and Cool; Lightweight: 13.1 oz.; 1400-Watts; 5-foot power cord; Cord-loop for hanging storage; Easy-clean filter", "image": "http://images.ulta.com/is/image/Ulta/2507278,\nhttp://images.ulta.com/is/image/Ulta/2507278_prod_altimg_1,\nhttp://images.ulta.com/is/image/Ulta/2507278_prod_altimg_2,\nhttp://images.ulta.com/is/image/Ulta/2507278_prod_altimg_3", "price": "$99.99", "sub_title": "", "brand": "Panasonic", "title": "Online Only Nanoe Compact Hair Dryer", "catalogs": "Hair, Hair Styling Tools, Hair Dryers", "url": "http://www.ulta.com/nanoe-compact-hair-dryer?productId=xlsImpprod15701045"},

Get better results in half the time* with the Tria Hair Removal Laser 4X, the only FDA-cleared laser available for home use. The upgraded digital display featuring Tria's exclusive pulse counter lets you treat your face and body more confidently.

Unlike other at-home hair removal methods, the Tria Hair Removal Laser uses the same laser technology used by professionals for in-office laser hair removal for permanent results in the comfort and privacy of the home, at a fraction of the cost.  Key Benefits:      Dermatologist recommended for permanent results.     Clinically proven to eliminate the need for regular shaving and waxing.     FDA-cleared.     Proven safe and effective.

And the angled tip gives you enhanced visibility to deliver laser light with expert precision to the treatment area.  FDA-cleared: Tria Hair Removal Laser 4X is FDA-cleared. This means that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has cleared the Tria Laser 4X to be marketed as safe and effective.

When treating weekly for three months, you should expect the following results:      After your first month: Clinical studies have shown up to 70% reduction after just two treatments. (On occasion, some users experience mild redness that quickly dissipates within 24 hours after your first treatment.)     After 2-3 months of treatment: Hair re-growth will begin to appear lighter and finer. You will begin to see a visible reduction in the amount of re-growth, especially in areas where hair growth tends to be dense.     After 3 months of treatment: Hair follicles that have been deactivated by the Tria Hair Removal Laser 4X will no longer grow hair.
