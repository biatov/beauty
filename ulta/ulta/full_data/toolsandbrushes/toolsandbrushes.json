With an easy flick of the rocker switches, any combination of these settings can be used to match your hair texture and length. For example, the low-heat, low-speed setting is ideal for delicate, fine hair of all lengths, while the high-heat, high-speed setting is best suited for thick or long hair.

Anywhere. With the foldable, lightweight, 1400-Watt Nanoe Compact Hair Dryer, you can dry and style hair beautifully at home, the gym or anywhere without drying it out. Nanoe creates and infuses moisture-rich particles into your hair while you dry to protect against heat and everyday brushing. Leaving you with smooth, shiny, healthy looking hair, wherever you go.So how does the Panasonic nanoe advantage work? Put simply, the nanoe hair dryer helps strengthen, protect and beautify hair by taking moisture from the outside and putting it on the inside. The instant you switch on the travel hair dryer, naturally occurring ions in the air are drawn in and broken down into significantly smaller particles that are then combined and held together by water molecules. These new nanoe particles - each containing 1,000x more moisture than regular ions - are gently infused into your hair while drying and styling. The result? Smoother, shinier hair and reduced damage from brushing.The lightweight nanoe travel hair dryer makes it easy to dry and style at home or on the go. The compact design and quick-fold handle fit neatly into bags and luggage for easy drying and touch-ups at the gym, work and travel wherever, whenever. When not in use, the space-saving folding hair dryer stores easily in drawers, on shelves or on a hook with the handy hanging loop.Panasonic's exclusive Quick-dry Nozzle simultaneously directs strong and soft airflows into the hair. It's the ideal design for concentrated styling, smooth, even drying from roots to ends and faster drying time. The Panasonic EH-NA27-K mini hair dryer delivers 1400-Watt power and high, medium and cool airflow settings to accommodate different styles, hair types and drying times. An easy-clean filter helps keep your Panasonic nanoe compact hair dryer running like new and operating at peak performance.Key Features:Panasonic nanoe technology; Compact Design with Folding Blowdryer Handle; Unique Quick-Dry Nozzle; 3 Airflow Settings: High, Medium and Cool; Lightweight: 13.1 oz.; 1400-Watts; 5-foot power cord; Cord-loop for hanging storage; Easy-clean filter", "catalogs": "Hair, Hair Styling Tools, Hair Dryers", "sub_title": ""},

No more unsightly dry, chalky skin! Comes with built-in protection against microbial contamination of the brush.Compatible with only the Soniclear Elite model.The inventors of Soniclear recognized that skin cells and moisture remaining on pedi and brush heads between uses can create conditions for bacteria to grow. So all Soniclear pedi and brush attachments are treated during the manufacturing process with proprietary LIFE antimicrobial product protection - a Soniclear exclusive - to guard against the growth of stain and odor causing bacteria. Traditional pedicure and skin cleansing systems do not provide this protection. The antimicrobial protection in Soniclear is registered with the US Environmental Protection Agency to guard against stain and odor causing bacteria on the brush heads of your Soniclear.In laboratory tests, surfaces treated with the antimicrobial in Soniclear showed 99.9% inhibition of stain and odor causing bacteria after 24 hours compared with an untreated control. Safe, effective and long lasting, the antimicrobial product protection in Soniclear Pedi and brush attachments will not wash out or wear off for the normal life of the attachment so Pedi and brush attachments stay cleaner, fresher for longer. Antimicrobial product protection is not a substitute for good hygienic practices nor is it intended to protect the user from disease causing microorganisms.
