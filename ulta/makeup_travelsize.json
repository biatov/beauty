Yep, this baby actually lowers the temperature of your makeup to keep foundation, eyeshadow, blush and concealer in place - even in hot and humid or cold and windy conditions. The result? Smoother-looking skin and vibrant makeup that lasts all day (or all night).In a 7-day study of All Nighter:*78% of participants said All Nighter helped their makeup last for 16 hours.; Over 80% said their makeup not only looked better, it stayed on better (even in the T-zone) without settling into fine lines.; Whether they had combination, oily or dry skin, 88% or more said All Nighter was the best product to help their makeup last.*Based on a 50-person study.This breakthrough formula comes in a black soft-touch bottle with a purple sprayer and a frosted white cap. Unlike similar products on the market, the sprayer delivers a calibrated, microfine mist that goes on so light, you'll hardly feel it - and once you've applied it, you won't even know it's there (until you look in the mirror to touch up your makeup, and realize you don't need to). If you've tried other setting sprays that feel sticky or tight on your skin, you'll be AMAZED by how different this is.

Hello vibrant, long-lasting makeup.Developed in an exclusive partnership with Skindinavia, UD's groundbreaking, tested formula is free of oil and parabens and features patented Temperature Control Technology. Yep, this baby actually lowers the temperature of your makeup to help it stay put and keep skin looking smooth (but never shiny).In a 7-day study of De-Slick:*100% of participants said De-Slick helped prevent makeup meltdown.; Over 90% said their makeup looked less shiny, didn\u00bft slide and rarely needed to be touched up.; 85% said De-Slick is the longest-lasting oil-control product they've ever used.*Based on a 35-person study.This breakthrough formula comes in a black soft-touch bottle with a purple sprayer and a frosted white cap. Unlike similar products on the market, the sprayer delivers a calibrated, microfine mist that goes on so light, you'll hardly feel it - and once you've applied it, you won't even know it's there (until you look in the mirror to touch up your makeup, and realize you don't need to).

To finally give woman a simple solution to getting the \"Tightline\" effect using a black lash primer. To give woman an ultra black formula that lengthens and thickens lashes without clumping, protects and conditions lashes and maximizes the results of your favorite mascara that is also paraben-free, fragrance-free, and sulfate-free.What is it: Tightline Full Lash Length Black Eyelash Primer is a true game-changer in mascara and eyeliner technology. This multi-tasking beauty must-have utilizes an ultra-skinny wand, allowing you to start coating your lashes at their actual root, so you coat black along your entire lash length (unlike most mascara brushes that are too large to get to the root, leaving the first 1/3 of your lash roots bare!). This gives you ultimate length and volume. But the best part is, if you have sparse or missing lashes, the Tightline brush lays down black pigment along your entire lash line, filling in spare spots, giving you a full beautiful lash line and the look of an eyeliner! This creates instant definition without taking up extra eye lid Space. The skinny wand also allows the conditioning serum to infuse a blend of lash-enhancing ingredients including peptides, collagen, proteins, biotin, nettle extract, green tea, jojoba, and vitamins all the way down to the root of your lashes, giving your lashes the most effective dosage of nourishment and protection. Tightline is also paraben-free, fragrance-free, phthalate-free, sulfate-free, and is it great for even the most sensitive eyes.Who is it for: Anyone who wants lashes for miles! Anyone with sparse lashes who wants the look of a full lash line. Anyone who wants thicker, longer, fuller-looking, amazing lashes that reach their full potential. Anyone who wants the look of the Tightline eyeliner effect. Why is it different: Tightline Full Lash Length Black Eyelash Primer Skinny wand gives you the power to coat each lash beginning at the root, unlike most mascaras wands that leave the bottom 1/3 of your lashes uncoated. This also creates a natural Tightline eyeliner effect along your upper and lower lash line, because it lays down black pigment between each eyelash at the root, creating instant definition without taking up extra eye lid space. The skinny wand also allows the conditioning serum to infuse a blend of lash-enhancing ingredients including peptides, collagen, proteins, biotin, nettle extract, green tea, jojoba, and vitamins all the way down to the root of your lashes, giving your lashes the most effective dosage of nourishment and protection. Tightline is also paraben-free, fragrance-free, phthalate-free, sulfate-free, and is it great for even the most sensitive eyes.", "brand": "It Cosmetics", "catalogs": "Makeup, Eyes, Mascara"},

Dermaxyl helps smooth the appearance of wrinkles, and Kalpariane plumps, firms and hydrates skin as it improves suppleness and elasticity.\n\nThe shade is similar to Urban Decay's Original Eye Shadow Primer Potion, which dries down invisibly, but with a tiny bit of sheer pigment to even out and color-correct the skin.\n\nEasy on the eyes in more ways than one, this coveted primer now comes in revamped packaging with gorgeous ombr\u00e9 artwork and a faceted, jewel-like cap.
